 We divided up the bulk of the project in that Mina did cat.cpp and Freda did wc.cpp as a whole. Mina also wrote env.cpp. We both contributed to the 
 project through little edits here and there and collaborated in making the other .cpp files. We worked together by collaborating in term fo getting
 the logistics of the project implementation and corrected each other in small logic errors here and there.

 We both upheld our individual commitments very well. We were both timely and were able to uphold our commitments to each other in terms of the amount
of workload we decided on. Overall our teamwork was beneficial in that we both did our assigned commitments and also helped each other out with shared 
work. We also were able to work through each other, catching one another in logic errors that we would have missed if programming by ourselves.
