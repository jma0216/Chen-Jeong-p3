 We divided up the bulk of the project in that Mina did size.cpp, dirlist.cpp and Freda did newer.cpp and forkpid.cpp. We worked together by collaborating and getting
 the logistics of the project and corrected each other in small logic errors here and there.

 We both upheld our individual commitments very well. We were both timely and were able to uphold our commitments to each other in terms of the amount
of workload we decided on. Overall our teamwork was beneficial in that we both did our assigned commitments and also helped each other out with shared 
work. We also were able to work through each other, catching one another in logic errors that we would have missed if programming by ourselves..
